# lightpinkchess
set up some basic code to handle moves, captures and turns. 
structure is garbage. check/stale/mate/ing, castling isnt implemeted yet, 
will probably get back to it once exams are over -- 
if i dont scrap it altogether and start again that is.
i can do better, plus i hate chess. 

light pink might just be my thing.
